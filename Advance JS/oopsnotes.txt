Programming = real life ne advance banava mate it is called programming.

OOPS = Object oriented programming language.

Object oriented Programming language is used to real time entities ne reuse karva mate code reability
come karva mate.

Four Pillars of oops 

1) Abstration 
2) Inheritance 
3) Polymorphism
4) Encapsulation

1) Abstration = Real time entities ne hide karva mate like we have done code we hide the code after
click on logout user only see message but not see code.

2) Inheritance = Parent - child ek object ni vastu bija ne made it also says upgradation.

3) Encapsulation = ex we have keyboard, cpu, desktop screen and mouse we set all togther and create a
system that is called Encapsulation.

Reakl time Multiple entities we have create one entity that is called Encapsulation.


4) Polymorphim = Multiple feature ek class inside it is called Polymorshipm
